description:: Towards publishing my notes and research as self-describing, public information.

- I have created a basic setup (with much room for improvement) for publishing notes from #Logseq as self-describing #Linked-Data .
- The end goal is to have a public repository of my notes which can be easily linked to by external sources and indexed in a self-describing fashion.
- To utilise this with Logseq, I have deployed Logseq's [rdf-export](https://github.com/logseq/rdf-export) Github Action to convert this graph into #N-Quads and #JSON-LD , as well as [graph-validator](https://github.com/logseq/graph-validator), to validate my Logseq graph against a given schema.
- The current implementation can get found at [my notes repository](https://github.com/chadsr/notes).
- From the generated #JSON-LD, I render a simple list of #Logseq graph entries onto my [website](https://ross.ch), under the notes section.
- Furthermore, a full interactive #Logseq #SPA is [hosted here](https://notes.ross.ch).
