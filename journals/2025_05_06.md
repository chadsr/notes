description:: Towards publishing my notes and research as self-describing, public information

- I have created a basic setup (with much room for improvement) for publishing notes from Logseq as self-describing linked-data.
- The end goal is to have a public repository of my notes which can be easily linked to by external sources and indexed in a self-describing fashion.
